# WatchyoJet
An Air Traffic Controller’s job is considered to be one of the most stressful jobs in the world as they manage complex operations to maintain aircraft separation and optimize runway usage without any aircraft collision. WatchyoJet will be a web based autonomous air traffic controller decision system that will make these decisions efficiently without any unforeseen errors. This will help the ATC to monitor the situation and automate the decision-making process reducing the workload. Existing softwares like ERAM are human operated and this project aims to replace the controller with an autonomous system that can generate conflict free ATC commands.  The software will take aircraft headings (direction), altitude, speed, distance from the airport, runway availability, weather forecast etc into account and devise real time decisions to help in airport operations such as landing, takeoffs and taxiing emergency fires etc. The intended users are big commercial airports, military airbases along with very small airports that have almost no air traffic. This project is valuable because the current ATC systems in USA are outdated and need replacement.
